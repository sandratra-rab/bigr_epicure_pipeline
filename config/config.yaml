# Must be one of the following
# Main differences:
# * `chip-seq`:
#    - Base pipeline
#
# * `atac-seq`: 
#    - Read shifting is performed on aligned reads (on BAM files, after deduplication)
#
# * `cut&run` :
#    - No deduplication
#    - Seacr is used as a peak caller alongside with Macs2
#
# * `cut&tag` :
#    - No deduplication
#
# * `medip-seq`:
#    - CpG density calculation for peak-coverage normalization/merging/QC
#
# * `og-seq`:
#   - Specific bias accounted in CSAW
#
# * `gro-seq`:
#   - Specific bias accounted in CSAW
#
# * `ribo-seq`:
#   - Specific bias accounted in coverage analysis
#
# * `mnase-seq`:
#   - Specific bias accounted in coverage analysis
