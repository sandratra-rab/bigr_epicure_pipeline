# Must be one of: `chip-seq`, `atac-seq`, `medip-seq`
# Main differences:
# * `chip-seq`:
#
# * `atac-seq`: 
#    - Read shifting is performed on aligned reads (on BAM files, after deduplication)
#
# * `cut&run` :
#
# * `cut&tag` :
#
# * `medip-seq`:
#    - CpG density calculation for peak-coverage normalization/merging/QC
#
# * `og-seq`:
#
protocol: cut&run

# with the following columns (case matters, order does not matter):
# - Sample_id       (Required)  Must be unique
# - Upstream_file   (Required)
# - Downstream_file (Optional)  Optional for single-ended libraries
# - Fragment_size   (Optional)  Required if and only if sample is single-ended
# - Input           (Optional)  Optional Sample_id of the corresponding input file. 
#                               Leave empty if this file is an Input.
# - Protocol        (Optional)  See `protocol` above
# - Organism        (Optional)  Ensembl organism name. eg. `homo_sapiens`
